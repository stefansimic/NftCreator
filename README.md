# NftCreator
To use the NFT creator, you have to change modify the NftAssetComponentEnum.java with your component-names.
Your image components have to be in one directory where you have a directory for each element in the NftAssetComponentEnum.java (with the same name as the enum-value). You also need a "output" directory where the output will be generated. To use the default value of a component, you have to have an assetcomponent with the enum-value and "00001.png" as a name. An Example would be the assetComponent with the name "MOUTH". Here you have to name de default asset "MOUTH00001.png".
The GUI (JFrame) is temporary and will be remade in the future. For now it works.
